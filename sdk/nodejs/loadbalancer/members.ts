/**
 * Manages a V2 members resource within OpenStack (batch members update).
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource has attributes that depend on octavia minor versions.
 * Please ensure your Openstack cloud supports the required minor version.
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource works only within Octavia API. For
 * legacy Neutron LBaaS v2 extension please use
 * openstack.loadbalancer.Member resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const members1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Members("members_1", {
 *     members: [
 *         {
 *             address: "192.168.199.23",
 *             protocolPort: 8080,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             address: "192.168.199.24",
 *             protocolPort: 8080,
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     poolId: "935685fb-a896-40f9-9ff4-ae531a3a00fe",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer Pool Members can be imported using the Pool ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/members:Members members_1 c22974d2-4c95-4bcb-9819-0afc5ed303d5
 * ```
