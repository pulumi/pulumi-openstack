/**
 * Manages a V2 members resource within OpenStack (batch members update).
 *
 * > **Note:** This resource works only within Octavia API. For
 * legacy Neutron LBaaS v2 extension please use
 * openstack.loadbalancer.Member resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const members1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Members("members1", {
 *     members: [
 *         {
 *             address: "192.168.199.23",
 *             protocolPort: 8080,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             address: "192.168.199.24",
 *             protocolPort: 8080,
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     poolId: "935685fb-a896-40f9-9ff4-ae531a3a00fe",
 * });
 * ```
