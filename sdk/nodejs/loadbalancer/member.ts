/**
 * Manages a V2 member resource within OpenStack.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const member1 = new openstack.loadbalancer.Member("member_1", {
 *     poolId: "935685fb-a896-40f9-9ff4-ae531a3a00fe",
 *     address: "192.168.199.23",
 *     protocolPort: 8080,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Load Balancer Pool Member can be imported using the Pool ID and Member ID
 * separated by a slash, e.g.:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import openstack:loadbalancer/member:Member member_1 c22974d2-4c95-4bcb-9819-0afc5ed303d5/9563b79c-8460-47da-8a95-2711b746510f
 * ```
