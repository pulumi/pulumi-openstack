/**
 * Associates a floating IP to a port. This is useful for situations
 * where you have a pre-allocated floating IP or are unable to use the
 * `openstack.networking.FloatingIp` resource to create a floating IP.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const port1 = new openstack.networking.Port("port1", {
 *     networkId: "a5bbd213-e1d3-49b6-aed1-9df60ea94b9a",
 * });
 * const fip1 = new openstack.networking.FloatingIpAssociate("fip1", {
 *     floatingIp: "1.2.3.4",
 *     portId: port1.id,
 * });
 * ```
