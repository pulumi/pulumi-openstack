/**
 * Manages a V2 floating IP resource within OpenStack Neutron (networking)
 * that can be used for load balancers.
 * These are similar to Nova (compute) floating IP resources,
 * but only compute floating IPs can be used with compute instances.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const floatip1 = new openstack.networking.FloatingIp("floatip1", {
 *     pool: "public",
 * });
 * ```
