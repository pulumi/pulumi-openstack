/**
 * Use this data source to get authentication information about the current
 * auth scope in use. This can be used as self-discovery or introspection of
 * the username or project name currently in use as well as the service catalog.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const scope = pulumi.output(openstack.identity.getAuthScope({
 *     name: "my_scope",
 * }));
 * ```
 *
 * To find the the public object storage endpoint for "region1" as listed in the
 * service catalog:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 *
 * const objectStoreService = .filter(entry => entry.type == "object-store").map(entry => entry)[0];
 * const objectStoreEndpoint = .filter(endpoint => endpoint["interface"] == "public" && endpoint.region == "region1").map(endpoint => endpoint)[0];
 * const objectStorePublicUrl = objectStoreEndpoint.url;
 * ```
