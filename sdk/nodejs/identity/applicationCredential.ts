/**
 * Manages a V3 Application Credential resource within OpenStack Keystone.
 *
 * > **Note:** All arguments including the application credential name and secret
 * will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. Read more about sensitive data
 * in state.
 *
 * > **Note:** An Application Credential is created within the authenticated user
 * project scope and is not visible by an admin or other accounts.
 * The Application Credential visibility is similar to
 * `openstack.compute.Keypair`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Predefined secret
 *
 * Application credential below will have only one `swiftoperator` role.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const swift = new openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("swift", {
 *     name: "swift",
 *     description: "Swift technical application credential",
 *     secret: "supersecret",
 *     roles: ["swiftoperator"],
 *     expiresAt: "2019-02-13T12:12:12Z",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Unrestricted with autogenerated secret and unlimited TTL
 *
 * Application credential below will inherit all the current user's roles.
 *
 * !> **WARNING:** Restrictions on these Identity operations are deliberately
 * imposed as a safeguard to prevent a compromised application credential from
 * regenerating itself. Disabling this restriction poses an inherent added risk.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const unrestricted = new openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("unrestricted", {
 *     name: "unrestricted",
 *     description: "Unrestricted application credential",
 *     unrestricted: true,
 * });
 * export const applicationCredentialSecret = unrestricted.secret;
 * ```
 *
 * ### Application credential with access rules
 *
 * > **Note:** Application Credential access rules are supported only in Keystone
 * starting from [Train](https://releases.openstack.org/train/highlights.html#keystone-identity-service) release.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 *
 * const monitoring = new openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("monitoring", {
 *     name: "monitoring",
 *     expiresAt: "2019-02-13T12:12:12Z",
 *     accessRules: [
 *         {
 *             path: "/v2.0/metrics",
 *             service: "monitoring",
 *             method: "GET",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             path: "/v2.0/metrics",
 *             service: "monitoring",
 *             method: "PUT",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Application Credentials can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import openstack:identity/applicationCredential:ApplicationCredential application_credential_1 c17304b7-0953-4738-abb0-67005882b0a0
 * ```
