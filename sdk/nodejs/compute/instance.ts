/**
 * Manages a V2 VM instance resource within OpenStack.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ### Basic Instance
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const basic = new openstack.compute.Instance("basic", {
 *     flavorId: "3",
 *     imageId: "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743",
 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     metadata: {
 *         this: "that",
 *     },
 *     networks: [{
 *         name: "my_network",
 *     }],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Instance With Attached Volume
 * 
 * ```typescript

 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const myvol = new openstack.blockstorage.VolumeV2("myvol", {
 *     size: 1,
 * });
 * const myinstance = new openstack.compute.Instance("myinstance", {
 *     flavorId: "3",
 *     imageId: "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743",
 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     networks: [{

 *     }],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * const attached = new openstack.compute.VolumeAttach("attached", {
 *     instanceId: myinstance.id,
 *     volumeId: myvol.id,
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Boot From Volume
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const boot_from_volume = new openstack.compute.Instance("boot-from-volume", {
 *     blockDevices: [{
 *         bootIndex: 0,
 *         deleteOnTermination: true,
 *         destinationType: "volume",
 *         sourceType: "image",
 *         uuid: "<image-id>",
 *         volumeSize: 5,
 *     }],
 *     flavorId: "3",
 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     networks: [{

 *     }],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Boot From an Existing Volume
 * 
 * ```typescript

 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     networks: [{
 *         name: "my_network",
 *     }],
 *     personalities: [{
 *         content: "contents of file",
 *         file: "/path/to/file/on/instance.txt",
 *     }],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Instance with Multiple Ephemeral Disks
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const multi_eph = new openstack.compute.Instance("multi-eph", {
 *     blockDevices: [
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: 0,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "image",
 *             uuid: "<image-id>",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: -1,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "blank",
 *             volumeSize: 1,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: -1,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "blank",
 *             volumeSize: 1,
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     flavorId: "3",
 *     imageId: "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743",
 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Instance with User Data (cloud-init)
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const instance1 = new openstack.compute.Instance("instance_1", {
 *     flavorId: "3",
 *     imageId: "ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743",
 *     keyPair: "my_key_pair_name",
 *     networks: [{
 *         name: "my_network",
 *     }],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 *     userData: `#cloud-config
 * hostname: instance_1.example.com
 * fqdn: instance_1.example.com`,
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * `user_data` can come from a variety of sources: inline, read in from the `file`
 * function, or the `template_cloudinit_config` resource.
 * 
 * ## Notes
 * 
 * ### Multiple Ephemeral Disks
 * 
 * It's possible to specify multiple `block_device` entries to create an instance
 * with multiple ephemeral (local) disks. In order to create multiple ephemeral
 * disks, the sum of the total amount of ephemeral space must be less than or
 * equal to what the chosen flavor supports.
 * 
 * The following example shows how to create an instance with multiple ephemeral
 * disks:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const foo = new openstack.compute.Instance("foo", {
 *     blockDevices: [
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: 0,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "image",
 *             uuid: "<image uuid>",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: -1,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "blank",
 *             volumeSize: 1,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             bootIndex: -1,
 *             deleteOnTermination: true,
 *             destinationType: "local",
 *             sourceType: "blank",
 *             volumeSize: 1,
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     securityGroups: ["default"],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Instances and Security Groups
 * 
 * When referencing a security group resource in an instance resource, always
 * use the _name_ of the security group. If you specify the ID of the security
 * group, Terraform will remove and reapply the security group upon each call.
 * This is because the OpenStack Compute API returns the names of the associated
 * security groups and not their IDs.
 * 
 * Note the following example:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const sg1 = new openstack.networking.SecGroup("sg_1", {});
 * const foo = new openstack.compute.Instance("foo", {
 *     securityGroups: [sg1.name],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Instances and Ports
 * 
 * Neutron Ports are a great feature and provide a lot of functionality. However,
 * there are some notes to be aware of when mixing Instances and Ports:
 * 
 * * In OpenStack environments prior to the Kilo release, deleting or recreating
 * an Instance will cause the Instance's Port(s) to be deleted. One way of working
 * around this is to taint any Port(s) used in Instances which are to be recreated.
 * See [here](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/126309/) for further information.
 * 
 * * When attaching an Instance to one or more networks using Ports, place the
 * security groups on the Port and not the Instance. If you place the security
 * groups on the Instance, the security groups will not be applied upon creation,
 * but they will be applied upon a refresh. This is a known OpenStack bug.
 * 
 * * Network IP information is not available within an instance for networks that
 * are attached with Ports. This is mostly due to the flexibility Neutron Ports
 * provide when it comes to IP addresses. For example, a Neutron Port can have
 * multiple Fixed IP addresses associated with it. It's not possible to know which
 * single IP address the user would want returned to the Instance's state
 * information. Therefore, in order for a Provisioner to connect to an Instance
 * via it's network Port, customize the `connection` information:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as openstack from "@pulumi/openstack";
 * 
 * const port1 = new openstack.networking.Port("port_1", {
 *     adminStateUp: true,
 *     networkId: "0a1d0a27-cffa-4de3-92c5-9d3fd3f2e74d",
 *     securityGroupIds: [
 *         "2f02d20a-8dca-49b7-b26f-b6ce9fddaf4f",
 *         "ca1e5ed7-dae8-4605-987b-fadaeeb30461",
 *     ],
 * });
 * const instance1 = new openstack.compute.Instance("instance_1", {
 *     networks: [{
 *         port: port1.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
