        Manages a V3 Application Credential resource within OpenStack Keystone.

        > **Note:** All arguments including the application credential name and secret
        will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data
        in state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

        > **Note:** An Application Credential is created within the authenticated user

        ## Example Usage

        ### Predefined secret

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        swift = openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("swift",
            description="Swift technical application credential",
            expires_at="2019-02-13T12:12:12Z",
            roles=["swiftoperator"],
            secret="supersecret")
        ```

        ### Unrestricted with autogenerated secret and unlimited TTL

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        unrestricted = openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("unrestricted",
            description="Unrestricted application credential",
            unrestricted=True)
        pulumi.export("applicationCredentialSecret", unrestricted.secret)
        ```

        ### Application credential with access rules

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        monitoring = openstack.identity.ApplicationCredential("monitoring",
            access_rules=[

               an application credential will never expire. Changing this creates a new
               application credential.

               credential.

               credential may be used for creation or destruction of other application
               credentials or trusts. Changing this creates a new application credential.
