        ## Example Usage

        ### Simple port

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        network1 = openstack.networking.Network("network1", admin_state_up="true")
        port1 = openstack.networking.Port("port1",
            admin_state_up="true",
            network_id=network1.id)
        ```

        ### Port with physical binding information

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        network1 = openstack.networking.Network("network1", admin_state_up="true")

        ### Ports and Instances

        There are some notes to consider when connecting Instances to networks using
        Ports. Please see the `compute.Instance` documentation for further
        documentation.

               this updates the `description` of an existing port.

               `true`, then no security groups are applied to the port. If set to `false` and

        :param pulumi.Input[str] tenant_id: The owner of the Port. Required if admin wants

        :param pulumi.Input[list] security_group_ids: A list
               of security group IDs to apply to the port. The security groups must be
               specified by ID and not name (as opposed to how they are configured with
               the Compute Instance).
        :param pulumi.Input[list] tags: A set of string tags for the port.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] tenant_id: The owner of the Port. Required if admin wants
               to create a port for another tenant. Changing this creates a new port.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] value_specs: Map of additional options.

        The **allowed_address_pairs** object supports the following:

          * `ip_address` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The additional IP address.
          * `mac_address` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The additional MAC address.

        The **binding** object supports the following:

          * `hostId` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The ID of the host to allocate port on.
          * `profile` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Custom data to be passed as `binding:profile`. Data
            must be passed as JSON.
          * `vifDetails` (`pulumi.Input[dict]`) - A map of JSON strings containing additional
            details for this specific binding.
          * `vifType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The VNIC type of the port binding.
          * `vnicType` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - VNIC type for the port. Can either be `direct`,
            `direct-physical`, `macvtap`, `normal`, `baremetal` or `virtio-forwarder`.
            Default value is `normal`.

        The **extra_dhcp_options** object supports the following:

          * `ip_version` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - IP protocol version. Defaults to 4.
          * `name` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Name of the DHCP option.
          * `value` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Value of the DHCP option.

        The **fixed_ips** object supports the following:

          * `ip_address` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The additional IP address.
          * `subnet_id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Subnet in which to allocate IP address for
            this port.
