        Manages a V2 security group resource within OpenStack.

        Please note that managing security groups through the OpenStack Compute API
        has been deprecated. Unless you are using an older OpenStack environment, it is
        recommended to use the `networking.SecGroup`
        and `networking.SecGroupRule`
        resources instead, which uses the OpenStack Networking API.

        ## Example Usage



        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        secgroup1 = openstack.compute.SecGroup("secgroup1",
            description="my security group",
            rules=[
                {
                    "cidr": "0.0.0.0/0",
                    "fromPort": 22,
                    "ipProtocol": "tcp",
                    "toPort": 22,
                },
                {
                    "cidr": "0.0.0.0/0",
                    "fromPort": 80,
                    "ipProtocol": "tcp",
                    "toPort": 80,
                },
            ])
        ```

        ## Notes

        ### ICMP Rules

        When using ICMP as the `ip_protocol`, the `from_port` sets the ICMP _type_ and the `to_port` sets the ICMP _code_. To allow all ICMP types, set each value to `-1`, like so:

        ```python
        import pulumi
        ```

        A list of ICMP types and codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol#Control_messages).

        ### Referencing Security Groups

        When referencing a security group in a configuration (for example, a configuration creates a new security group and then needs to apply it to an instance being created in the same configuration), it is currently recommended to reference the security group by name and not by ID, like this:

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_openstack as openstack

        test_server = openstack.compute.Instance("test-server",
            flavor_id="3",
            image_id="ad091b52-742f-469e-8f3c-fd81cadf0743",
            key_pair="my_key_pair_name",
            security_groups=[openstack_compute_secgroup_v2["secgroup_1"]["name"]])
        ```

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: A description for the security group. Changing this
               updates the `description` of an existing security group.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: A unique name for the security group. Changing this
               updates the `name` of an existing security group.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client.
               A Compute client is needed to create a security group. If omitted, the
               `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new
               security group.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] rules: A rule describing how the security group operates. The
               rule object structure is documented below. Changing this updates the
               security group rules. As shown in the example above, multiple rule blocks
               may be used.

        The **rules** object supports the following:

          * `cidr` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Required if `from_group_id` or `self` is empty. The IP range
            that will be the source of network traffic to the security group. Use 0.0.0.0/0
            to allow all IP addresses. Changing this creates a new security group rule. Cannot
            be combined with `from_group_id` or `self`.
          * `fromGroupId` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - Required if `cidr` or `self` is empty. The ID of a
            group from which to forward traffic to the parent group. Changing this creates a
            new security group rule. Cannot be combined with `cidr` or `self`.
          * `fromPort` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - An integer representing the lower bound of the port
            range to open. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
          * `id` (`pulumi.Input[str]`)
          * `ipProtocol` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - The protocol type that will be allowed. Changing
            this creates a new security group rule.
          * `self` (`pulumi.Input[bool]`) - Required if `cidr` and `from_group_id` is empty. If true,
            the security group itself will be added as a source to this ingress rule. Cannot
            be combined with `cidr` or `from_group_id`.
          * `toPort` (`pulumi.Input[float]`) - An integer representing the upper bound of the port
            range to open. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
