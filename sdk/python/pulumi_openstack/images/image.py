        ### Properties
        
        This resource supports the ability to add properties to a resource during
        creation as well as add, update, and delete properties during an update of this
        resource.
        
        Newer versions of OpenStack are adding some read-only properties to each image.
        These properties start with the prefix `os_`. If these properties are detected,
        this resource will automatically reconcile these with the user-provided
        properties.
        
        In addition, the `direct_url` property is also automatically reconciled if the
        Image Service set it.
